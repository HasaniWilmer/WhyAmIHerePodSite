                                <p>Well first of all, this is a film about Vengeance. That being said, this is arguably the best Batman film because it is actually Batman being Batman, a one track minded psychopath that is constantly vigilant and detecting. Robert Pattinson plays Vengeance throughout the film. Bruce Wayne is not necessarily a character because Vengeance is the true version of Bruce. Vengeance stalks and moves deliberately. He strikes fear in the criminals of Gotham and beating the shit out of them when they get in his way. But, the psychopath known as Vengeance finally meets his match in The Riddler. Paul Dano deliver an acting performance that can only be compared to Heath Ledger’s Joker. Zoë Kravitz plays the best Selena Kyle putting Michelle Pfeiffer to shame. There is a lot that I loved about this film even though it was almost 3 hours long. You definitely feel the runtime while watching it but the conclusion makes it all worth it, and you really understand the purpose of the film. It is a journey of Vengeance becoming The Batman.


                                P.S. there are hints in this film that can lead to a trilogy and I pray that a trilogy comes out of this amazing film.

                                <p>First off, that is a big boy. I was curious to how I would feel about this film. A film that was nominated for several awards at the Oscars. Brenden Fraser won an Oscar. Best Actor winner and it totally makes sense. Story wise I thought it was fairly average. Going into the film, I think I was expecting more from Darren Aronofsky. Coming off of Mother! (A film I thought was better than people gave it credit for), I thought I would feel more, emotions. But overall I did enjoy the film and the experience of watching with people kept it more entertaining.

                                <p>One of the best paced films I have ever seen with a near 3 hour long runtime. From fighting to story, Chapter 4 maximizes the world built by the previous 3 films. The series introduces new characters that make the most impact outside of the core cast. This is the best film in the series with a climactic yet satisfying ending. RIP Lance Reddick.

                                <p> Cure is definitely a pillar in psychological thriller genre. Methodically paced and atmospheric, this film digs into your mind, like its victims, through suggestions. At first, I thought it was a supernatural horror but it follows teachings from psychology and metaphysics. While the film was fairly straightforward, I feel as though this film warrants a rewatch because of something’s I may have missed. But like any good psychological film, a discussion is needed. Can you suggest someone to commit murder, going against their morals, or was that thought always there in the back of their mind?

                                    P.S. I watched this film due to an Ari Aster suggestion

Even though the effects were dated, it only added to the overall presentation of the film. It was madness incarnate. Follow a group of girls as the stay at a carnivorous house picking them off one by one. The music mesmerizes you through this Scooby Doo inspired adventure with a Kung Fu theme sticking out the most. I had such a pleasant experience watching this film and I can see how some filmmakers could have used House as a blueprint. Surely, this film is not for everyone but it will absolutely make anyone laugh and remember what it is like to enjoy films again.

                                <p> I thought Evil Dead (2013) was a superior film. Evil Dead Rise was ok and had its moments. Classic white people playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes. It certainly fit the tone of Evil Dead. I just feel like something was missing. The deaths were not impactful and the writing was a little lackluster. I did have a great time watching it but Evil Dead Rise was not the best in the franchise as it seems a lot of people think.</p>

                                <p> This felt like the unofficial prequel to Crimes of The Future but in my own head canon it is directly connected to Crimes of The Future. With that being said, Videodrome is the catalyst of ExistenZ forming the David Cronenberg cinematic universe of his fears of what could happen if humans let desire and stimuli take over and control us. It makes no sense but if you watch ExistenZ, Crimes of The Future, and Videodrome in that order it will all make sense.</p>
